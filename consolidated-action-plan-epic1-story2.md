   @router.get("/health", tags=["System"])
   ```

2. **Async Context Manager Pattern**
   ```python
   # Future pattern for resource cleanup
   async def __aenter__(self):
       return self
   async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
       # cleanup logic
   ```

3. **Domain Exception Enhancement**
   ```python
   # Expand domain/exceptions.py
   class ProductValidationError(DomainException):
       pass
   ```
