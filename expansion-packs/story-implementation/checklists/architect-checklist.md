# Architect Checklist - Technical Architecture Review

## Purpose
Validate technical design, architecture compliance, and implementation quality against established standards and patterns.

## Checklist Items

### 1. Hexagonal Architecture Compliance
- [ ] **Domain Layer Isolation**: Domain entities and services are free from infrastructure dependencies
- [ ] **Port-Adapter Pattern**: Proper Protocol interfaces defined for external dependencies
- [ ] **Dependency Direction**: Dependencies flow inward (infrastructure → application → domain)
- [ ] **Interface Segregation**: Domain interfaces are minimal and focused on business operations
- [ ] **Domain Service Purity**: Domain services contain only business logic, no infrastructure concerns

### 2. Module Structure and Organization
- [ ] **Module Boundaries**: Clear separation between modules (auth, user, product, etc.)
- [ ] **Layer Separation**: Proper api/, application/, domain/, infrastructure/ structure
- [ ] **Protocol Compliance**: Service implementations follow defined Protocol interfaces
- [ ] **Import Dependencies**: No circular dependencies between modules or layers
- [ ] **File Organization**: Files are located in appropriate directories per architectural standards

### 3. API Design and Integration
- [ ] **RESTful Endpoints**: API endpoints follow consistent naming and HTTP verb conventions
- [ ] **Request/Response Schemas**: Proper Pydantic models for validation and serialization
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses and status codes
- [ ] **Authentication Integration**: Proper JWT middleware integration without breaking existing endpoints
- [ ] **API Versioning**: Endpoint versioning strategy consistent with existing patterns

### 4. Data Access and Persistence
- [ ] **Repository Pattern**: Proper repository abstraction with Protocol interfaces
- [ ] **Database Schema**: Database models align with domain entities
- [ ] **Migration Strategy**: Database migrations are safe and reversible
- [ ] **Transaction Management**: Proper transaction boundaries and error handling
- [ ] **Query Optimization**: Efficient database queries with appropriate indexes

### 5. Security Architecture
- [ ] **Authentication Flow**: Secure JWT implementation with proper token lifecycle
- [ ] **Password Security**: Strong password hashing with appropriate salt rounds
- [ ] **Token Management**: Secure token storage and refresh mechanisms
- [ ] **Authorization Middleware**: Proper middleware integration for route protection
- [ ] **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization and validation

### 6. Configuration and Environment
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration externalized to environment variables
- [ ] **Configuration Management**: Proper settings management with validation
- [ ] **Secret Management**: No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data in code
- [ ] **Environment Isolation**: Clear separation between development, test, and production configs
- [ ] **Dependency Injection**: Proper DI container setup for service resolution

### 7. Testing Architecture
- [ ] **Test Organization**: Tests structured by layer (unit, integration, api)
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage achieved
- [ ] **Mocking Strategy**: Proper mocking of external dependencies
- [ ] **Test Data Management**: Clean test data setup and teardown
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Real database integration tests with proper isolation

### 8. Code Quality and Standards
- [ ] **Type Safety**: Proper type annotations throughout codebase
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with proper error types
- [ ] **Code Documentation**: Clear docstrings and inline comments for complex logic
- [ ] **Code Style**: Consistent formatting and naming conventions
- [ ] **SOLID Principles**: Code follows SOLID design principles

### 9. Performance and Scalability
- [ ] **Database Performance**: Proper indexing and query optimization
- [ ] **Caching Strategy**: Appropriate caching implementation where needed
- [ ] **Resource Management**: Proper connection pooling and resource cleanup
- [ ] **Async/Await**: Proper async patterns for I/O operations
- [ ] **Memory Management**: No obvious memory leaks or excessive resource usage

### 10. Integration and Compatibility
- [ ] **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing API contracts
- [ ] **Frontend Integration**: Proper API contracts for frontend consumption
- [ ] **Third-party Integration**: External service integrations follow established patterns
- [ ] **Deployment Compatibility**: Implementation works with existing deployment pipeline
- [ ] **Configuration Compatibility**: No conflicts with existing configuration structure
