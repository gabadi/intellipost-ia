- All authentication flows work correctly
- Comprehensive error handling in place

### Phase 2: Quality Standards (4-6 hours)
**Priority:** QUALITY-STANDARD
1. Resolve 85 linting errors using Ruff
2. Implement rate limiting for auth endpoints
3. Complete HTTPS configuration for production
4. Implement accessibility improvements (WCAG compliance)
5. Enhance error handling and user feedback

**Success Criteria:**
- Zero linting errors
- Rate limiting functional (5 attempts/minute)
- HTTPS enforced in production
- Accessibility improvements implemented
- Better error handling and user feedback

### Phase 3: Documentation & Validation (2-3 hours)
**Priority:** DOCUMENTATION
1. Complete story documentation as per DoD
2. Run comprehensive test suite
3. Validate all fixes against review criteria

**Success Criteria:**
- Story documentation complete
- All tests passing
- Review criteria satisfied

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **Login Endpoint Fix:** Critical path, requires careful debugging
