# Next Steps

## MVP Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
**Goal:** Core infrastructure and basic photo flow

**Critical Components:**
1. **Photo Collection Component** - Camera integration + gallery picker
2. **Prompt Input Component** - Required text input with validation
3. **Processing Spinner Component** - AI processing feedback
4. **Basic dashboard** - Add Product button + simple product list

**Deliverable:** User can take photos → add prompt → see processing

### Phase 2: AI Integration (Week 3-4)
**Goal:** Complete Quick Approval flow

**Critical Components:**
1. **Generated Listing Preview Component** - Display AI results
2. **Confidence Indicator** - Visual confidence scoring
3. **Action Button** - PUBLISH NOW primary action
4. **MercadoLibre integration** - Actual publishing capability

**Deliverable:** Full Quick Approval flow working end-to-end

### Phase 3: Edit Capabilities (Week 5-6)
**Goal:** Complete Balanced Review flow

**Critical Components:**
1. **Edit Interface Component** - Prompt editing + manual tweaks
2. **AI regeneration** - Update & Regenerate functionality
3. **Form validation** - Error states and field validation
4. **Success states** - Published confirmation + Create Another

**Deliverable:** Full mobile-complete experience

### Phase 4: Polish & Optimization (Week 7-8)
**Goal:** Production-ready MVP

**Focus Areas:**
1. **Performance optimization** - Photo compression, caching
2. **Error handling** - Network issues, processing failures
3. **UI polish** - Animations, micro-interactions
4. **Testing** - Edge cases, various devices

**Deliverable:** Production-ready MVP

## Immediate Actions

1. **Technical Architecture:** Define frontend architecture based on this specification
2. **API Definition:** Specify AI processing and MercadoLibre integration APIs
3. **Development Setup:** Initialize project with MVP-focused tech stack

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### High-Risk Components (Address Early)
1. **Camera Integration** - Test on multiple devices in Phase 1
2. **AI Processing Time** - Mock with realistic delays, plan for timeouts
3. **MercadoLibre API** - Validate integration early in Phase 2
4. **Photo Upload Performance** - Test on slow networks immediately

### Fallback Plans
- **AI Processing Fails:** Manual editing interface as backup
- **MercadoLibre Down:** Save draft, retry queue
- **Poor Network:** Offline photo storage, upload when connected
- **Slow AI Response:** Clear messaging, user can continue elsewhere

### Success Metrics to Track
- **Time to First Listing:** <60 seconds (measure in Phase 2)
- **Upload Success Rate:** >95% (monitor from Phase 1)
- **Processing Success Rate:** >90% (track from Phase 2)
- **User Completion Rate:** >80% complete full flow (measure in Phase 3)
