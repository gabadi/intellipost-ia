# Performance Considerations - MVP Mobile-First

## MVP Performance Goals

**Core App Performance:**
- **App Load:** <3 seconds for initial dashboard load on 3G
- **Photo Upload:** <5 seconds for multiple photos on mobile network
- **AI Processing:** 10-15 seconds typical, 30 seconds maximum
- **UI Response:** <100ms for all tap interactions
- **Animation:** 60fps for confidence indicators and transitions

**Critical User Experience Targets:**
- **Time to First Listing:** <60 seconds from photo capture to published
- **Photo Processing:** Real-time preview while uploading
- **Processing Feedback:** Progress indication within 2 seconds of starting
- **Network Resilience:** Graceful degradation on slow connections

## MVP Design Strategies

**Mobile-Optimized Performance:**
- **Image Compression:** Automatic compression before upload
- **Progressive Upload:** Show UI while photos upload in background
- **Offline Resilience:** Cache user inputs during network issues
- **Memory Management:** Limit photo resolution for processing
- **Component Lazy Loading:** Load edit interface only when needed

**AI Processing Optimization:**
- **Processing Feedback:** Immediate spinner with encouraging messaging
- **Timeout Handling:** Clear error states after 30 seconds
- **Background Processing:** Allow other interactions during AI processing
- **Retry Logic:** Automatic retry on processing failures

**Network Considerations:**
- **3G Compatibility:** App functional on slower mobile networks
- **Data Usage:** Optimize photo sizes for mobile data plans
- **Caching:** Cache processed results to avoid re-processing
