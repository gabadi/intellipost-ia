   - Stories: [1.1, 1.2, 1.3] - Complete development ecosystem with automated quality gates

### Top 3 Epic Improvement Areas (Team Consensus)

1. **Test Architecture Standardization** | Votes: 5/5 | Impact: HIGH
   - Root Cause: Integration testing patterns not established across backend/frontend boundary
   - Stories Affected: [1.2, 1.3] - API integration tests added reactively rather than proactively

2. **Mobile Testing Protocol Implementation** | Votes: 4/5 | Impact: HIGH
   - Root Cause: No real device testing workflow established for mobile-first development
   - Stories Affected: [1.3] - Mobile UX validated in browser only, not on actual devices

3. **Security Dependency Management** | Votes: 4/5 | Impact: MEDIUM
   - Root Cause: Transitive dependency vulnerabilities detected late in development cycle
   - Stories Affected: [1.1, 1.3] - Security scanning needs CI/CD integration for early detection
