## Epic Stories (MVP Essential)

### Story 6.1: User Authentication & JWT System
**Focus**: Core login/logout functionality with mobile-optimized JWT strategy
- JWT access tokens (15 min) and refresh tokens (7 days) for mobile performance
- bcrypt password hashing with basic strength validation
- Mobile-first login/registration forms with 44px touch targets
- Protocol-based authentication service integration
- Basic user storage (users table with id, email, password_hash)
- Basic session management and JWT validation

### Story 6.2: MercadoLibre OAuth Integration
**Focus**: Essential OAuth flow for core product functionality
- OAuth 2.0 flow with PKCE for mobile security
- Pre-auth education modal and seamless OAuth handoff
- Basic token storage (user_ml_tokens table with access/refresh tokens)
- Connection status indicators (connected/disconnected states)
- Basic error handling for OAuth failures

---

## UX Integration (From UX Expert Guidelines)

### Mobile-First Security Patterns
- **Touch Optimization**: 44px minimum touch targets for all security elements
- **Progressive Trust**: Allow basic usage before requiring full verification
- **Thumb-Friendly Layout**: Primary security actions in bottom 1/3 of screen
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Color coding for security states (green=secure, yellow=pending, red=required)

### Authentication Flow Design
- **Single-Screen Auth**: Minimal fields with progressive disclosure
- **Persistent Sessions**: 7-day timeout with "Remember Me" default enabled
- **Password UX**: Visibility toggle and auto-fill support
- **Error Communication**: Action-oriented messages with clear recovery steps

### MercadoLibre Integration UX
- **Entry Point**: "Connect MercadoLibre" button on dashboard
- **Education Flow**: Modal explaining connection benefits before OAuth
- **Status Visibility**: Always show connection status in publishing screens
- **Reconnection**: One-tap reconnect without re-entering credentials

---

## Technical Architecture (From Architect Guidelines)

### JWT Strategy
```python
# Mobile-optimized token configuration
JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = 15    # Battery optimization
JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS = 7       # User convenience
JWT_ALGORITHM = "HS256"                 # Sufficient for MVP
```

### Protocol Integration
```python
# Extend existing hexagonal architecture
class AuthenticationService(Protocol):
    async def authenticate_user(self, email: str, password: str) -> AuthResult
    async def validate_token(self, access_token: str) -> AuthenticatedUser
    async def refresh_token(self, refresh_token: str) -> TokenPair

class CredentialManager(Protocol):
    async def store_ml_credentials(self, user_id: UUID, tokens: MLTokens) -> None
    async def encrypt_api_key(self, key: str) -> str
```

### Security Configuration
```python
# 80/20 Security configuration for MVP
class SecurityConfig:
    PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH = 8
    API_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE = 60
    AI_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE = 5
    MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB = 50
    CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHM = "AES-256-GCM"
```

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] **Existing APIs Unchanged**: No breaking changes to current API endpoints
- [ ] **Database Compatibility**: New tables with foreign keys to existing schema
- [ ] **Frontend Integration**: Security components follow existing SvelteKit patterns
- [ ] **Performance Impact**: Minimal overhead from security middleware
- [ ] **Mobile Performance**: Maintain <100KB bundle targets and touch optimization

---

## Implementation Priority (80/20 Focus)

### Essential Security (Epic 6 MVP - Include Now)
✅ **High Impact, Essential for Functionality**
- Email/password authentication with JWT
- MercadoLibre OAuth integration
- Basic session management
- Basic token storage (plain text initially)
- Basic error handling and connection status

### Enhanced Security (Post-Epic 6 - Future Enhancement)
⏳ **Security Hardening Features**
- Advanced credential encryption (AES-256)
- API rate limiting and input validation
- Security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)
- Advanced session management (device tracking)
- Multi-factor authentication (2FA)
- Security audit logs and monitoring

## Risk Mitigation

### Primary Risk: Integration Complexity
**Risk**: Security implementation could break existing functionality
**Mitigation**:
- Protocol-based implementation maintains existing interfaces
- Gradual rollout with feature flags
- Comprehensive testing of existing endpoints
- Security middleware as optional layer

### Rollback Plan
1. **Feature Flags**: All security features behind toggleable flags
2. **Database Rollback**: Security tables can be added/removed without affecting core schema
3. **Frontend Rollback**: Security components are isolated and removable
4. **API Rollback**: Security middleware can be disabled while maintaining functionality
