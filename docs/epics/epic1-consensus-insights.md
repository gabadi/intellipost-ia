## Top 3 Epic Improvement Areas (Team Consensus)

1. **Documentation-Implementation Synchronization** | Votes: 5/5 | Impact: HIGH
   - Root Cause: Post-completion validation gap between documented state and actual repository state
   - Stories Affected: 1.1 (configuration drift detected)
   - Team Consensus: Need systematic post-implementation verification workflow to prevent developer setup inconsistencies

2. **Tool Version Compatibility Management** | Votes: 4/5 | Impact: MEDIUM
   - Root Cause: ESLint 9.x compatibility required configuration format updates, modern tool version cascading effects
   - Stories Affected: 1.1 (frontend tooling integration challenges)
   - Team Consensus: Proactive tool compatibility testing and version management strategy needed

3. **Team Knowledge Transfer Process** | Votes: 5/5 | Impact: HIGH
   - Root Cause: 7 knowledge gaps identified across monorepo practices, hexagonal architecture, and Protocol-based design
   - Stories Affected: 1.1, 1.2 (comprehensive learning items captured)
   - Team Consensus: Structured knowledge sharing sessions needed to ensure team-wide capability development
