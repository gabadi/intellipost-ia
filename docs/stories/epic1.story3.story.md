## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Insights
From Epic1.Story2 completion:
- Backend FastAPI application is running on localhost:8000 with health check at /health
- CORS is configured to allow requests from localhost:3000 (SvelteKit default port)
- Backend follows hexagonal architecture with clear API layer separation
- Quality tools (Ruff, Pyright) are enforced and frontend must follow similar standards

### Data Models
**API Response Types** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#frontend-types]:
```typescript
// API response interfaces for backend communication
interface HealthCheckResponse {
  status: string;
  timestamp: string;
  version: string;
}

interface APIResponse<T> {
  data: T;
  error?: string;
  success: boolean;
}

interface Product {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  status: ProductStatus;
  confidence?: number;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}

type ProductStatus = 'uploading' | 'processing' | 'ready' | 'publishing' | 'published' | 'failed';
```

### API Specifications
**Backend Health Check Integration** [Source: previous story completion]:
```typescript
// Health check endpoint communication
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:8000';

async function checkBackendHealth(): Promise<HealthCheckResponse> {
  const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/health`);
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`Backend health check failed: ${response.status}`);
  }
  return response.json();
}

// CORS configuration already allows:
// - Origin: http://localhost:3000
// - Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS
// - Headers: All (*) allowed
```

### Component Specifications
**Mobile-First SvelteKit Configuration** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-framework]:
```javascript
// svelte.config.js - Mobile optimization
import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-auto';
import { vitePreprocess } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';

const config = {
  preprocess: vitePreprocess(),
  kit: {
    adapter: adapter(),
    alias: {
      $components: 'src/lib/components',
      $stores: 'src/lib/stores',
      $utils: 'src/lib/utils',
      $types: 'src/lib/types'
    }
  }
};

// vite.config.js - Performance optimization
export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    target: 'es2022',
    cssMinify: true,
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        manualChunks: {
          vendor: ['svelte', '@sveltejs/kit']
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
```

**Mobile Navigation Component Pattern** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#mobile-components]:
```svelte
<!-- MobileNavigation.svelte structure -->
<script lang="ts">
  import { page } from '$app/stores';

  interface NavItem {
    path: string;
    label: string;
    icon: string;
  }

  const navItems: NavItem[] = [
    { path: '/', label: 'Dashboard', icon: 'üè†' },
    { path: '/products/new', label: 'New Product', icon: '‚ûï' },
    { path: '/products', label: 'Products', icon: 'üì¶' }
  ];

  $: currentPath = $page.url.pathname;
</script>

<!-- Fixed bottom navigation for mobile -->
<nav class="mobile-nav">
  {#each navItems as item}
    <a href={item.path} class:active={currentPath === item.path}>
      <span class="icon">{item.icon}</span>
      <span class="label">{item.label}</span>
    </a>
  {/each}
</nav>

<style>
  .mobile-nav {
    position: fixed;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    display: flex;
    background: white;
    border-top: 1px solid #e5e7eb;
    min-height: 60px; /* Above 44px touch target requirement */
  }
</style>
```

test('health check connects to backend', async () => {
  const response = await checkBackendHealth();
  expect(response.status).toBe('healthy');
  expect(response.version).toBe('1.0.0');
});
```
