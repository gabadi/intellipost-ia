# Technical Decisions Needed - Epic 6 Story 1

**Decision Date:** 2025-06-27
**Architect:** Scrum Master Agent
**Story:** Epic 6.1 - User Authentication & JWT System
**Status:** DECISIONS REQUIRED FOR IMPLEMENTATION

## Executive Summary

The Round 1 review consolidation has identified **5 critical technical decisions** that must be resolved before proceeding with story implementation. These decisions impact security architecture, testing strategy, and deployment pipeline integration.

## Critical Technical Decisions

### 1. Token Storage Security Strategy

**DECISION REQUIRED:** How to implement secure token storage for mobile-web hybrid application

**OPTIONS:**
- **Option A:** HTTP-only cookies with SameSite=Strict (current plan)
- **Option B:** Secure localStorage with encryption
- **Option C:** Hybrid approach - refresh tokens in HTTP-only cookies, access tokens in memory

**STAKEHOLDERS:** Architecture team, Security team, Frontend team
**IMPACT:** High - affects entire authentication flow
**TIMELINE:** Must decide by end of week
**RECOMMENDATION:** Option A with additional CSRF protection

### 2. Test Coverage Strategy

**DECISION REQUIRED:** Testing approach to achieve 80%+ coverage requirement

**OPTIONS:**
- **Option A:** Comprehensive unit + integration + E2E testing (12-15 days)
- **Option B:** Focus on critical path testing with gradual expansion (6-8 days)
- **Option C:** Automated testing with manual validation backup (8-10 days)

**STAKEHOLDERS:** QA team, Development team, DevOps team
**IMPACT:** High - determines story completion timeline
**TIMELINE:** Decision needed for sprint planning
**RECOMMENDATION:** Option B with commitment to expand in subsequent iterations

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline Integration

**DECISION REQUIRED:** How to integrate authentication services with existing pipeline

**OPTIONS:**
- **Option A:** Full pipeline rebuild with authentication integration
- **Option B:** Gradual integration with feature flags
- **Option C:** Separate authentication service deployment pipeline

**STAKEHOLDERS:** DevOps team, Platform team, Security team
**IMPACT:** Medium - affects deployment strategy
**TIMELINE:** Must align with existing release schedule
**RECOMMENDATION:** Option B to minimize risk

### 4. Database Migration Strategy

**DECISION REQUIRED:** User table migration approach for production deployment

**OPTIONS:**
- **Option A:** Single migration with full user schema
- **Option B:** Incremental migrations with backward compatibility
- **Option C:** Blue-green deployment with schema versioning

**STAKEHOLDERS:** Database team, DevOps team, Platform team
**IMPACT:** High - affects data integrity and rollback capability
**TIMELINE:** Critical for production deployment
**RECOMMENDATION:** Option B for safety and rollback capability

### 5. Error Handling Architecture

**DECISION REQUIRED:** Standardized error handling across authentication services

**OPTIONS:**
- **Option A:** HTTP status codes with structured error responses
- **Option B:** Application-level error codes with metadata
- **Option C:** Hybrid approach - HTTP status + application error details

**STAKEHOLDERS:** Frontend team, Backend team, API team
**IMPACT:** Medium - affects client integration and debugging
**TIMELINE:** Needed for API contract definition
**RECOMMENDATION:** Option C for comprehensive error handling

## Priority Resolution Order

### Phase 1: Architecture Decisions (Week 1)
1. **Token Storage Security Strategy** - Blocks authentication implementation
2. **Database Migration Strategy** - Required for infrastructure setup
3. **Error Handling Architecture** - Needed for API development

### Phase 2: Implementation Decisions (Week 2)
4. **Test Coverage Strategy** - Determines development approach
5. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration** - Required for deployment readiness

## Decision Dependencies

```
Token Storage ← Security Architecture ← Frontend Implementation
Database Migration ← Infrastructure Setup ← Backend Implementation
Error Handling ← API Contract ← Client Integration
Test Coverage ← Development Approach ← Quality Assurance
CI/CD Integration ← Deployment Strategy ← Production Readiness
```

## Escalation Matrix

**Architecture Decisions:** Lead Architect + Security Team
**Process Decisions:** Scrum Master + DevOps Team
**Quality Decisions:** QA Lead + Development Team
**Business Decisions:** Product Owner + Stakeholder Review

## Decision Timeline

| Decision | Deadline | Owner | Dependencies |
|----------|----------|--------|--------------|
| Token Storage | 2025-06-28 | Lead Architect | Security team approval |
| Database Migration | 2025-06-28 | Platform Lead | DBA review |
| Error Handling | 2025-06-29 | API Lead | Frontend team input |
| Test Coverage | 2025-06-30 | QA Lead | Development capacity |
| CI/CD Integration | 2025-07-01 | DevOps Lead | Platform readiness |

## Risk Mitigation

**HIGH RISK:** Delayed decisions impact sprint commitment
- **Mitigation:** Daily decision review meetings
- **Fallback:** Simplified MVP approach with technical debt tracking

**MEDIUM RISK:** Architecture decisions affect other stories
- **Mitigation:** Architecture review board approval
- **Fallback:** Isolated authentication service deployment

**LOW RISK:** Testing strategy affects quality metrics
- **Mitigation:** Incremental testing approach
- **Fallback:** Manual testing with automated test development

## Next Steps

1. **Schedule Architecture Review:** Token storage and database migration decisions
2. **Convene Technical Committee:** Review all 5 decisions with stakeholders
3. **Create Timeline:** Align decision schedule with development sprint
4. **Document Decisions:** Update story technical guidance with approved approaches
5. **Communicate Impact:** Inform development team of decision outcomes

**DECISION REVIEW MEETING:** Scheduled for 2025-06-27 2:00 PM
**ATTENDEES:** Architecture team, QA lead, DevOps lead, Product Owner
