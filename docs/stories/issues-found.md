## Critical Blocker Analysis

**IMMEDIATE BLOCKERS (Must resolve for story completion):**
1. Test coverage implementation (QA requirement)
2. CI/CD pipeline integration (deployment requirement)
3. Token storage security validation (architecture requirement)
4. Database migration scripts (infrastructure requirement)

**QUALITY GATE VIOLATIONS:**
1. Documentation completeness (DoD violation)
2. Error handling standardization (API contract violation)
3. Performance testing (SLA requirement)

## Implementation Impact Assessment

**Total Estimated Effort:** 12-15 development days
**Critical Path Items:** 7 required-for-completion items
**Quality Standard Items:** 4 items (can be deferred to next iteration)
**Future Enhancements:** 4 items (future stories/epics)

**Risk Assessment:**
- HIGH: Process review failure indicates significant technical debt
- MEDIUM: QA conditional approval requires immediate attention
- LOW: UX and Business reviews provide strong foundation
