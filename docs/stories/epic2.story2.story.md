# Story 2.2: Secure Storage of Raw Product Inputs

## Status: Done

## Story

**As a** user of the IntelliPost AI platform,
**I want** my uploaded images and product data to be securely stored and properly managed,
**so that** I can trust that my product information is safe, accessible, and ready for AI processing.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Images stored in secure object storage**
   - All uploaded images must be stored in S3-compatible object storage (MinIO for development)
   - Images must be accessible via secure URLs with appropriate access controls
   - Storage must support efficient retrieval for AI processing workflows

2. **Product metadata persisted in PostgreSQL**
   - Product core data (prompt_text, status, user_id) stored in relational database
   - Proper foreign key relationships maintained between users and products
   - Product status managed through defined state machine (uploading → processing → ready → publishing → published/failed)

3. **Secure URLs generated for image access**
   - Pre-signed URLs generated for temporary image access
   - URLs must expire within reasonable timeframe for security
   - Access URLs must be scoped to authenticated user ownership

4. **Correct relationships between product and images**
   - One product can have multiple images (1:N relationship)
   - Each image must be linked to exactly one product
   - Primary image designation must be tracked
   - Referential integrity maintained through foreign key constraints

5. **Automatic temporary file cleanup**
   - Temporary upload files must be cleaned up after successful storage
   - Failed uploads must have cleanup mechanisms
   - Orphaned files must be identified and removed

6. **Backup strategy defined**
   - Data backup procedures must be documented
   - Recovery procedures must be tested and validated
   - Backup retention policies must be established

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
From Epic 2 Story 1, the frontend upload interface is complete and provides:
- Mobile-optimized photo capture and upload functionality
- Form validation for images (JPG/PNG, max 8 images, size limits)
- Product creation API integration with POST /products endpoint
- Auto-save functionality for user data retention
- WebSocket integration for upload progress tracking

**Key Integration Points**: This story must implement the backend storage that the frontend is expecting to interact with via the `/products` API endpoint.

### Architecture Patterns

**Hexagonal Architecture Implementation** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#hexagonal-architecture]:
- **Domain Layer**: Pure business logic with Protocol interfaces
- **Application Layer**: Use cases orchestrating domain services
- **Infrastructure Layer**: External service implementations (SQLAlchemy, S3)
- **API Layer**: HTTP endpoints and data transformation

**Protocol-Based Communication** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#protocol-communication]:
- All external dependencies accessed via Protocol interfaces
- Static duck typing validated by Pyright at compile-time
- No cross-module imports - communication via dependency injection
- Zero runtime overhead for protocol compliance

### Security Requirements

**Data Security** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#data-security]:
```yaml
Encryption:
  - Database: Connection encryption (TLS)
  - File Storage: Encryption at rest and in transit
  - ML Credentials: AES-256 encryption at rest

API Security:
  - HTTPS only (TLS 1.3)
  - JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
  - Rate limiting per user/IP
  - Input validation on all endpoints
```

### Testing

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-requirements]:
- **Unit Tests**: Domain logic isolation using pytest
- **Integration Tests**: External service mocking with httpx-mock + respx
- **Repository Tests**: Test containers for PostgreSQL and MinIO
- **API Tests**: Full request/response testing with test client
- **Coverage Requirement**: Minimum 80% test coverage for all new code

**Test File Locations**: Tests co-located within module at `backend/modules/product_management/tests/`

**Test Database**: Separate test database with fixtures and cleanup between tests

### Error Handling

**Error Handling Strategy** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#error-handling]:
- Domain exceptions for business rule violations
- Infrastructure exceptions for external service failures
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- Graceful degradation for non-critical failures
- User-friendly error messages without exposing internal details

### Configuration Management

**Development Environment** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#development-environment]:
```yaml
Container Platform: Docker + Docker Compose
Services: PostgreSQL, MinIO, FastAPI, SvelteKit
Environment Variables:
  - DATABASE_URL: PostgreSQL connection string
  - S3_ENDPOINT_URL: MinIO endpoint for development
  - S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID: Storage access credentials
  - S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: Storage secret credentials
  - S3_BUCKET_NAME: Default bucket for image storage
```

## Testing

**Test Coverage Requirements**:
- Minimum 80% coverage for all new modules and services
- Unit tests for domain entities and business logic
- Integration tests with TestContainers for PostgreSQL and MinIO
- API endpoint tests with authentication and authorization scenarios
- Error handling tests for all failure modes

**Test Data Management**:
- Test fixtures for sample product data and images
- Database cleanup between test cases
- Mock external services for unit tests
- Real storage services for integration tests

**Performance Testing**:
- Load testing for multiple concurrent uploads
- Large file upload testing (up to 50MB total)
- Database performance testing with large datasets

**File**: backend/modules/product_management/domain/product_status_manager.py
- **Change**: Fixed status assignment from `ProductStatus.PROCESSED` to `ProductStatus.READY`
