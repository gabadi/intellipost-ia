## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Insights
From Epic1.Story1 completion:
- Project uses UV for Python dependency management with virtual environment in `.venv`
- Quality tools (Ruff, Pyright, Tach) are configured and must pass for story completion
- Pre-commit hooks are active and will enforce quality standards
- Monorepo structure is established with backend/ and frontend/ directories

### Data Models
**Core Business Entities** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#domain-entities]:
```python
# Domain entities to create as placeholders
@dataclass
class Product:
    id: UUID
    user_id: UUID
    status: ProductStatus
    confidence: Optional[ConfidenceScore] = None

@dataclass
class User:
    id: UUID
    email: str
    created_at: datetime
```

### API Specifications
**Health Check Endpoint** [Source: architecture/system-overview.md#performance-architecture]:
```python
# Health endpoint must return application status
@router.get("/health")
async def health_check() -> Dict[str, str]:
    return {
        "status": "healthy",
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
        "version": "1.0.0"
    }
```

### Component Specifications
**FastAPI Application Configuration** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-framework]:
- Use FastAPI with async/await support for future AI processing
- Configure automatic OpenAPI documentation at /docs
- Enable JSON response formatting
- Set application metadata (title: "IntelliPost AI Backend", version: "1.0.0")

**CORS Configuration** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#development-environment]:
```python
# Development CORS settings
origins = [
    "http://localhost:3000",  # SvelteKit development server
    "http://127.0.0.1:3000",
]

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=origins,
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

### File Locations
**Backend Structure** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#backend-structure]:
- Main application: `backend/main.py`
- Domain layer: `backend/domain/entities/`, `backend/domain/services/`
- Application layer: `backend/application/use_cases/`, `backend/application/dto/`
- Infrastructure layer: `backend/infrastructure/config/`
- API layer: `backend/api/routers/`, `backend/api/schemas/`

**Configuration Files** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#backend-structure]:
- Environment settings: `backend/infrastructure/config/settings.py`
- Application configuration: `backend/infrastructure/config/__init__.py`

### Testing Requirements
**Test Structure** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-strategy]:
```python
# Unit tests for domain logic
def test_product_creation():
    product = Product(id=uuid4(), user_id=uuid4(), status=ProductStatus.UPLOADING)
    assert product.status == ProductStatus.UPLOADING

# API tests for endpoints
async def test_health_endpoint():
    response = await client.get("/health")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()["status"] == "healthy"
```

### Technical Constraints
**Quality Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#quality-gates]:
- All Python code must pass Ruff linting and formatting
- Complete type annotations required for all functions
- Pyright type checking must pass with zero errors
- Tach architectural boundary validation must pass
- 80%+ test coverage required for domain logic

**Development Tools** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#development-tools]:
- Use UV for dependency management (already configured)
- Follow hexagonal architecture patterns with Protocol-based interfaces
- Implement "Agent Coding First" principles with clear, documented code

## Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [x] **pytest Unit Tests**: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [x] **pytest Integration Test**: location: `tests/api/test_health.py`
- [ ] **Manual E2E**: Not required for basic framework setup

Manual Test Steps:
- Start FastAPI application with `cd backend && uvicorn main:app --reload`
- Verify health endpoint returns 200 at http://localhost:8000/health
- Verify OpenAPI docs are accessible at http://localhost:8000/docs
- Check that CORS allows frontend connection from localhost:3000
