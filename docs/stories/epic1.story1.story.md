# Epic 1, Story 1: Initial Project Setup, Monorepo and Centralized Development and Quality Tools

## Story Information

**Epic**: Epic 1 - Base Platform and Initial Control Panel (The Smart Foundation)
**Story Number**: 1.1
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Approved
**Business Value**: Critical Foundation

## User Story

**As a** development team member
**I want** a fully configured monorepo with comprehensive development and quality tools
**So that** I can efficiently develop high-quality code following "Agent Coding First" principles with automated quality gates and consistent standards

## Business Context

This story establishes the foundational development infrastructure that enables the entire IntelliPost AI project. Without proper tooling and quality gates, subsequent development would be inconsistent, error-prone, and difficult to maintain. This foundation is critical for supporting the "Agent Coding First" approach that will accelerate development throughout the project lifecycle.

The story directly supports the project's core technical assumptions (Section 8.1-8.3 of PRD) including monorepo structure, modular architecture preparation, and quality gate enforcement per NFR8.1.
