- Rate limiting: 5 failed login attempts per email per 15 minutes
- Input validation: Email format validation, password strength requirements

**Integration Constraints** [Source: epic6-security-authentication.md#compatibility-requirements]:
- No breaking changes to existing API endpoints from Epic 1
- Database foreign keys to existing schema without migration conflicts
- Frontend authentication components must follow established mobile-first design patterns
- Authentication middleware must integrate with existing FastAPI application structure
- Quality gates: All existing tests must continue passing with new authentication layer

## Testing

### CONTEXT_REVIEW
- Story complexity: COMPLEX
- Implementation time: 45 minutes (fixes) vs 60-90 minutes estimated
- Quality gate failures: 4 failing tests due to missing password_hash parameter
- Review rounds required: 2 (Round 1 consolidation + Round 2 validation)
- Key technical challenges: JWT security implementation, comprehensive testing, CI/CD integration

### ARCH_CHANGE
- ARCH: User Domain Entity - Missing password_hash in UserCore constructor - Blocks all user tests - [Owner: architect] | Priority: HIGH | Timeline: Current
- ARCH: JWT Security - HTTP-only cookies vs localStorage decision - Performance vs security tradeoff - [Owner: architect] | Priority: MEDIUM | Timeline: Next
