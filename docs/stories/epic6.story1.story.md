# Epic 6, Story 1: User Authentication & JWT System

## Story Information

**Epic**: Epic 6 - Security & Authentication Foundation
**Story Number**: 6.1
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Done
**Business Value**: Critical - Enables secure user management and production readiness

## User Story

**As a** mobile application user
**I want** secure email/password authentication with persistent sessions
**So that** I can safely access my account and maintain login across app sessions without frequent re-authentication

## Business Context

This story establishes the core authentication foundation for IntelliPost AI, implementing a mobile-optimized JWT strategy that balances security with user convenience. The implementation directly enables secure multi-user support, protects user data, and provides the authentication layer required for MercadoLibre OAuth integration (Story 6.2).

The mobile-first approach with 15-minute access tokens and 7-day refresh tokens optimizes battery life while maintaining security. This foundation is critical for production deployment and supports all future features requiring user identification and authorization.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: User Registration Flow
- [ ] Email/password registration endpoint at POST /api/auth/register
- [ ] Email validation with proper format checking
- [ ] Password strength validation (minimum 8 characters)
- [ ] bcrypt password hashing with salt rounds of 10
- [ ] Duplicate email prevention with clear error messaging
- [ ] User stored in PostgreSQL users table with UUID primary key
- [ ] Registration returns JWT tokens immediately (auto-login)

### AC2: Login/Logout Implementation
- [ ] Login endpoint at POST /api/auth/login accepting email/password
- [ ] Secure password verification using bcrypt compare
- [ ] JWT access token (15 min) and refresh token (7 days) generation
- [ ] Logout endpoint at POST /api/auth/logout that invalidates tokens
- [ ] Failed login attempts tracked with rate limiting (5 attempts/15 min)
- [ ] Clear error messages for invalid credentials vs locked accounts

### AC3: JWT Token Management
- [ ] Access tokens expire after 15 minutes (mobile battery optimization)
- [ ] Refresh tokens expire after 7 days (user convenience)
- [ ] Token refresh endpoint at POST /api/auth/refresh
- [ ] Automatic token refresh in frontend when access token expires
- [ ] Secure token storage in httpOnly cookies for web
- [ ] Token validation middleware for protected endpoints

### AC4: Session Handling
- [ ] Persistent sessions with "Remember Me" default enabled
- [ ] Session information includes user_id, email, created_at
- [ ] Graceful handling of expired sessions with redirect to login
- [ ] Session status endpoint at GET /api/auth/session
- [ ] Clear session state management in frontend stores

### AC5: Mobile-First Authentication UI
- [ ] Login/register forms with 44px minimum touch targets
- [ ] Password visibility toggle with eye icon
- [ ] Auto-fill support for password managers
- [ ] Loading states during authentication requests
- [ ] Error messages below relevant form fields
- [ ] Success feedback with smooth transitions

### AC6: Protocol Integration
- [ ] AuthenticationService protocol implemented following hexagonal architecture
- [ ] Integration with existing user domain module
- [ ] Proper separation of authentication logic from API layer
- [ ] Duck typing maintained for flexibility
- [ ] All authentication operations async/await compatible

### AC7: Security Best Practices
- [ ] HTTPS-only cookie flags in production
- [ ] CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- [ ] Timing attack prevention in password comparison
- [ ] No sensitive data in JWT payload
- [ ] Proper error handling without information leakage

## Definition of Done

## Technical Notes

### JWT Configuration
```python
# Mobile-optimized token settings
JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = 15    # Battery optimization
JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS = 7       # User convenience
JWT_ALGORITHM = "HS256"                 # Sufficient for MVP
JWT_SECRET_KEY = os.environ["JWT_SECRET_KEY"]  # From environment
```

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Refresh tokens table
CREATE TABLE refresh_tokens (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    token_hash VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Protocol Implementation
```python
# Authentication service protocol
class AuthenticationService(Protocol):
    async def register_user(self, email: str, password: str) -> AuthResult
    async def authenticate_user(self, email: str, password: str) -> AuthResult
    async def validate_token(self, access_token: str) -> AuthenticatedUser
    async def refresh_token(self, refresh_token: str) -> TokenPair
    async def logout_user(self, user_id: UUID) -> None
```

### Mobile UI Patterns
- Bottom sheet for login/register forms
- Biometric prompt for future enhancement
- Persistent login state indicator in header
- One-tap logout from user menu
- Progressive disclosure for advanced options

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- Epic 1 completed (FastAPI + SvelteKit foundation)
- PostgreSQL database operational
- Environment variables configured for JWT secrets
- HTTPS configured for production deployment

### Blocks
- Story 6.2 (MercadoLibre OAuth requires authentication)
- All Epic 2-5 features requiring user identification

### Blocked By
- None (can begin immediately after Epic 1)

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: JWT Secret Key Exposure
**Impact**: Critical
**Probability**: Low
**Mitigation**: Store secrets in environment variables, rotate keys regularly, never commit secrets

### Risk: Password Reset Flow Complexity
**Impact**: Medium
**Probability**: Medium
**Mitigation**: Defer to post-MVP enhancement, provide clear communication about manual reset process

### Risk: Mobile Token Storage Security
**Impact**: High
**Probability**: Medium
**Mitigation**: Use secure storage APIs, httpOnly cookies for web, consider device-specific encryption

## Success Metrics

- User registration conversion rate >80%
- Login success rate >95% for valid credentials
- Average session duration >7 days with refresh tokens
- Token refresh success rate >99%
- Authentication latency <200ms for login
- Zero security incidents related to authentication

## Story Tasks (Estimate: 3-4 days)

1. **Database Schema and Migrations** (3-4 hours)
   - Create users and refresh_tokens tables
   - Set up Alembic migrations
   - Add indexes for email and token lookups

   - Implement auto-refresh logic
   - Add session persistence
   - Handle authentication states

5. **Mobile-First UI Components** (6-8 hours)
   - Create login/register forms
   - Implement password visibility toggle
   - Add loading and error states
   - Ensure 44px touch targets

6. **Integration and Testing** (4-6 hours)
   - Write unit tests for auth service
   - Create integration tests for flows
   - Test on mobile devices
   - Validate security measures

7. **Documentation and Cleanup** (2-3 hours)
   - Update API documentation
   - Add authentication setup guide
   - Security best practices doc
   - Code review and refactoring

## Notes

This story focuses on the essential authentication features following the 80/20 principle. Advanced features like password reset, email verification, and 2FA are intentionally deferred to post-MVP to maintain focus on core functionality.

The implementation must maintain compatibility with the existing hexagonal architecture and avoid breaking changes to current endpoints. Special attention should be paid to mobile performance and user experience, as this will be the primary interaction method for users.

The JWT strategy is specifically optimized for mobile usage - shorter access tokens reduce the window for token compromise while longer refresh tokens minimize user friction. This balance is critical for adoption.
