## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Insights
Based on Story 6.1 completion notes:
- **Critical Issue**: Login endpoint consistently fails with 500 Internal Server Error due to user verification status handling
- **Registration Success**: Registration endpoint works correctly (201 Created) and generates proper JWT tokens
- **Architecture Solid**: Hexagonal architecture with protocol-based design is well-implemented
- **Quality Debt**: Only 1 minor linting error (E402) remains, not the 1,597 originally reported
- **Testing Coverage**: 101/101 tests passing, indicating robust test foundation

### Authentication Service Analysis
From previous story implementation and QA review:
- **Root Cause**: User verification status handling in authentication service causes failures
- **JWT Generation**: Token generation logic works (proven by successful registration)
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt implementation with 12 salt rounds is correctly implemented
- **Database Layer**: User repository and storage working correctly

### Data Models
**User Entity** [Source: docs/stories/epic6.story1.story.md#data-models]:
```python
@dataclass
class User:
    id: UUID
    email: str
    password_hash: str
    first_name: Optional[str] = None
    last_name: Optional[str] = None
    is_active: bool = True
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: datetime
    last_login_at: Optional[datetime] = None
```

**Authentication DTOs** [Source: docs/stories/epic6.story1.story.md#authentication-dtos]:
```python
class LoginRequest(BaseModel):
    email: EmailStr
    password: str

class TokenResponse(BaseModel):
    access_token: str
    refresh_token: str
    token_type: str = "bearer"
    expires_in: int
    user: UserResponse
```

### API Specifications
**Authentication Endpoints** [Source: docs/stories/epic6.story1.story.md#api-specifications]:
```http
POST /auth/login
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "securepass123"
}

Expected Response (200):
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...",
  "refresh_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 900,
  "user": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe"
  }
}
```

### File Locations
**Backend Authentication Module** [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#backend-structure]:
- Authentication service: `backend/modules/user_management/domain/services/authentication.py`
- Authenticate user use case: `backend/modules/user_management/application/use_cases/authenticate_user.py`
- JWT service implementation: `backend/modules/user_management/infrastructure/services/jose_jwt_service.py`
- Password service: `backend/modules/user_management/infrastructure/services/bcrypt_password_service.py`
- Auth endpoints: `backend/modules/user_management/api/routers/auth_router.py`

### Testing Requirements
**Authentication Testing** [Source: docs/stories/epic6.story1.story.md#testing-requirements]:
```python
# Unit tests - Debug authentication service
def test_authenticate_user_with_valid_credentials():
    # Test successful authentication flow
    pass

def test_authenticate_user_with_invalid_credentials():
    # Test proper error handling for invalid credentials
    pass

def test_user_verification_status_handling():
    # Test specific bug - user verification status in login flow
    pass
```

### Technical Constraints
**Security Requirements** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#security-stack]:
- Passwords: bcrypt hashing with salt rounds = 12
- JWT tokens: HS256 algorithm for MVP simplicity
- Rate limiting: 5 attempts per minute per IP for auth endpoints
- Error handling: No sensitive information disclosure

**Mobile Performance** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#mobile-optimization]:
- Touch targets: 44px minimum for authentication form elements
- Token strategy: 15-minute access tokens, 7-day refresh tokens
- Bundle impact: <10KB addition to frontend bundle

### Architecture Integration
**Protocol-Based Implementation** [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#module-independence]:
- Zero cross-module imports maintained
- Static duck typing validated by Pyright
- Authentication protocols defined in domain/ports/
- Infrastructure implementations in infrastructure layer only

## Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [x] **pytest Unit Tests**: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [x] **pytest Integration Tests**: location: `backend/modules/user_management/tests/test_integration.py`
- [x] **Vitest Component Tests**: location: `frontend/tests/unit/auth/`
- [x] **Playwright E2E**: location: `frontend/tests/e2e/auth-login-flow.spec.ts`

Manual Test Steps:
- Register a new user through the frontend registration form
- Attempt to login with the registered credentials
- Verify login returns 200 status with JWT tokens
- Access a protected route with the received token
- Test login with invalid credentials returns 401 error
- Verify mobile responsive design works on 320px viewport
- Test account lockout after 5 failed login attempts
