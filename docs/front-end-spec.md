# IntelliPost AI UI/UX Specification

## Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for IntelliPost AI's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

### Overall UX Goals & Principles

#### Target User Personas

- **SME Sellers:** Small to medium-sized enterprise owners who need to quickly create professional listings on MercadoLibre. They value efficiency and want to reduce the time spent on listing creation by 90%.
- **Sole Proprietors:** Individual sellers who use mobile devices primarily and need a streamlined, mobile-complete workflow for listing creation.
- **Power Users:** Experienced sellers who want detailed control over their listings and prefer desktop interfaces for complex editing and image management.

#### Usability Goals

- **Time to First Listing:** New users can complete their first listing within 5 minutes of active interaction time
- **Mobile Completion Rate:** 90% of workflows can be completed on mobile devices without requiring desktop access
- **Approval Efficiency:** High-confidence listings (>85%) can be approved with a single tap
- **Error Recovery:** Users can recover from 90% of error states without abandoning their workflow
- **Learning Curve:** Interface adapts to user confidence level, showing more or less detail based on AI certainty

#### Design Principles

1. **Mobile-Complete, Desktop-Optional** - All essential workflows must be completable on mobile, with desktop providing enhanced capabilities
2. **Confidence-Driven Interface** - UI adapts based on AI confidence scores, showing appropriate levels of detail and control
3. **Progressive Disclosure** - Show only what's needed when it's needed, with options to expand for more detail
4. **Immediate Feedback** - Every action should have clear, immediate response with confidence indicators
5. **Professional Minimalism** - Clean, modern design that conveys professionalism and efficiency
